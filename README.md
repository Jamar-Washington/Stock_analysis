# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

In the VBA of Wall Street project, Steve just graduated with a degree in Finance. His parents are his first client and they want to invest in a particular green energy stock. He has asked us to assist him in looking at green energy stocks for his parents. Given the stocks of green energy companies in 2017 and 2018, we are able to help Steve tell his parents if the investing they are looking at is a good one and which stocks Steve's parents should also look for.

## Results

After going through the stocks of 2017 and 2018, the best stocks to look into is ENPH and RUN. They are the only two stocks that had positive returns in both years. DQ had a great 199.4 percent return on investment in 2017. However, DQ had a negative return on investment in 2018. Combined, over the past two years, DQ stock's were up over 100 percent. Overall, Steve's parents pick of DQ stocks overall was good, but the best stocks Steve should tell his parents to invest in is ENPH and RUN.

## Summary

### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
With the refactoring code, the time to run the code compared to the original code is exponentially better which is the main advantage of the code. Another advantage of the code is that the refactored code is very similar to the original code. That way, if there is a problem, it is easy to look at the original code and find what needs to be done with the refactored code. The original code is effective while the refactored code is effective and efficient.  

### Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
One of the advantages that the original code has is that the formatting code is separated from the analysis code. That way, it is easy to know if the formatting code work even if the analysis code had a problem. However, a disadvantage of the original code is the time it takes to run the code. Even though the code runs "fast", it takes over a second to run the codes for both 2017 and 2018

The advantage of the refactored code is that the code takes a fifth of the time.

Also, the code involves the formatting code. This is good because the code can run all the subroutines in the original code in a fraction of the time.
